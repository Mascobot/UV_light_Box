# Programmable UV light neutralizing Box for viruses using Raspberry Pi

Programmable UVC light box &amp; code for a container to neutralize virus &amp; germs.

UV-C light container to neutralize virus & germs controlled by a Raspberry Pi.
A couple of IMPORTANT notes:
1. If you ever build something like this, make sure the box is 100 % protected with the appropriate material to avoid UVC leakage (it goes through most plastics). Direct exposure to UVC is unsafe. I de-activated the UVC lights in this video as I am still waiting for a metal shield/cover to arrive that will go around it. 

2. To my knowledge, it's unclear if UVC has effects on COVID19, but research seems promising and some companies have *claimed* some success.

3. For neutralizing virus & germs, it's a function of how long they are exposed to the light, the wavelenght of the light, how powerful the lights are, and how close the lights are to the items.

Parts:

1. Raspberry Pi 4
2. 7 inch touch screen (ther are many options, but I used the official one from Raspberry Pi).
3. Raspberry Pi relays (that can be actiated with 3.3V. I used this one: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0057OC6D8/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o09_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1
4. UVC light (many options on eBay). I used 4 lights (two on the bottom and two on the top), 8 watts each and have a wavelenght of ~280nm
5. Cooler. 
6. Aluminum foil
7. Metal shield around the box to prevent UVC light leaking out (it's not visible to the human eye).
