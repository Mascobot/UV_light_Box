# Programmable UV light neutralizing Box for viruses using Raspberry Pi

Programmable UVC light box &amp; code for a container to neutralize virus &amp; germs.

UV-C light container to neutralize virus & germs controlled by a Raspberry Pi.
A couple of IMPORTANT notes:
1. If you ever build something like this, make sure the box is 100 % protected with the appropriate material to avoid UVC leakage (it goes through most plastics). Direct exposure to UVC is unsafe. I de-activated the UVC lights in this video as I am still waiting for a metal shield/cover to arrive that will go around it. 

2. To my knowledge, it's unclear if UVC has effects on COVID19, but research seems promising and some companies have *claimed* some success.
